## Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here you'll find a selection of projects I'm proud to have worked on.

*(In a real site, you'd typically list portfolio items here. For now, we'll just have one sample item created directly in the `content/portfolio` directory. You would use Eleventy's collection system to list them automatically.)*

### [Sample Portfolio Item Title]
*([Link to Sample Portfolio Item Page](/portfolio/sample-item/))*

![Sample Portfolio Item](/assets/images/portfolio-sample.jpg "Sample Portfolio Item")

This is a brief description of the sample portfolio item. It showcases my ability to [mention a skill or type of work].

*(You would repeat a similar structure for other items or, more typically, generate this list from a collection.)*
